This project is to support a set of people varied from the whole population. There are many
circumstances that an average hiker will come across. So as a group we have chosen the ‚Äútravelers/
adventure seekers /hikers‚Äù as our targeted customer base. Now people are encouraged to take more
challenges by participating more and more hiking events. So, the increased number of events based on
adventures can be seen in Sri Lanka as well. Our main goal is to support a hiker with the modern
technology in the best way possible.
Hiking is the most popular activity among the adventure travelers according to a report by
the Adventure Travel Trade Association. People tend to move towards those experience more and
more in these days. Globally, day by day clubs are setting up and the participants believe that the
most important components of an adventure experience were being in a natural environment,
learning, meaningful human experiences, and experiencing a new culture.
As our main problem we have considered hikers getting stranded. We have focused on
health issues also. Furthermore, the main dilemmas will be explained. Our main aim is to build a
secure portable system to the hikers/adventure seekers. Our aim will also be introduced briefly.
The way we can send his/her individual information to other teammates. In addition, how we can
help this traveler by giving the relevant information about the trail ahead will be another objective.
How we are going to overcome those problems, will be discussed under the objectives.
In the mean time we will discuss how we use the technology of sensors such as heartrate
and altitude sensors. Inputs and outputs for our microcontroller will also be sketched in this
proposal. Through an atmega32 micro controller we will build a reliable device for this special
aspiration. Certain resources will be required as heartrate sensor, modules and other resources will
be discussed. Cost estimation will also be submitted.
A device that can sense the environment and display the relevant information. Secure health
measuring system that update automatically. System that can connect travelers and inform them
purposely. Tallying these systems and making one efficient device will be a great impact on the people
(hikers /adventure seekers/ travelers).

There are seprated folder for each module. Each codes are seprated and independently. In this project, we have used following modules and connected to the port at ```Atmega32```.
| Module | PORT(S) |
| ------ | ------ |
| altitude | ```PC0, PC1``` |
| buzzer | ```PD5``` |
| compass | ```PC0, PC1``` |
| display | ```PC0, PC1``` |
| gps | ```PD0, PD1``` |
| pulse | ```PA2``` |
| temperature |  ```PD4``` |
| wifi | ```PD0, PD1``` |
| Keypad | ```PB0 - PB7``` |

You can use them based on your requirement.
